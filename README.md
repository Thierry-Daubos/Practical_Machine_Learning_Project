# Practical_Machine_Learning_Project
Machine Learning algorithm based on the dataset "Weight Lifting Exercises"

Our goal in this project is to design a Machine Learning algorithm based on the 
dataset "Weight Lifting Exercises", provided by the research group on 
[Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#weight_lifting_exercises) and
described in the article:   
Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H.  
Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises.  
Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13).  
Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013.

The idea is to a use collection of sensors data recorded from the Arm, Forearm, 
Belt and Dumbbell in order to predict "how well" Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curls 
are being performed by the wearer.
